        <h2>The Roots of Traditional South Korean Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Traditional South Korean cuisine has deep roots, shaped by centuries of cultural development and influenced by the ancient culinary practices of the Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE–668 CE). Known for its communal meals and balance of flavors, early Korean cooking laid the groundwork for the vibrant dishes enjoyed today.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Ingredients and Staples</h3>
        <p>Ancient Korean cuisine relied heavily on staples like rice, barley, and soybeans—cornerstones of South Korean food today. Soy sauce, fermented soybean paste (doenjang), and sesame oil, key elements in Korean kitchens, continue to define the nation’s culinary identity.</p>
        
        <h3>Rice and Grains</h3>
        <p>Rice, cultivated since prehistoric times, became the backbone of Korean meals. The influence of these early agricultural practices is evident in bibimbap, rice cakes, and other grain-based dishes that remain iconic in South Korea.</p>
        <h3>Meat, Seafood, and Proteins</h3>
        <p>Ancient Koreans developed techniques for preserving meat and fish through drying, salting, and fermenting, forming the basis for modern staples like bulgogi, galbi, and jeotgal (salted seafood). Kimchi, South Korea’s most famous dish, originated from ancient preservation methods.</p>
        
        <h3>Fermentation and Pickling</h3>
        <p>Fermentation, essential in traditional Korean cuisine, gave rise to staples like kimchi, gochujang (red chili paste), and ganjang (soy sauce). These techniques, perfected over centuries, remain at the heart of Korean cooking.</p>
        <h3>Culinary Techniques</h3>
        <p>Koreans mastered methods like grilling, steaming, and fermenting, creating a diverse range of dishes. These techniques evolved into iconic cooking styles such as barbecue (gogi-gui) and hotpots (jeongol), still popular in modern South Korea.</p>
        <p>The culinary legacy of ancient Korea, characterized by harmony, preservation, and bold flavors, continues to shape South Korean cuisine. Its commitment to tradition and innovation has earned it global acclaim as a cuisine of balance and depth.</p>
