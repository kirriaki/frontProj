        <h2>The Roots of Traditional Italian Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Traditional Italian cuisine stretches back centuries, intertwined with the rich culinary practices of the Roman Empire. Known for its grand feasts and innovative approach to food, the ancient Romans laid the foundation for the classic Italian dishes we enjoy today.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Ingredients and Staples</h3>
        <p>Roman cuisine used essential ingredients like olives, wheat, and grapes—pillars of Italian food today. Olive oil, a staple in Roman kitchens, continues to be central in Italian cooking, used for frying, flavoring, and as a base for dressings. The Romans also popularized herbs like rosemary and thyme, still found in Italian recipes.</p>
        
        <h3>Bread and Grains</h3>
        <p>The Roman Empire’s focus on wheat influenced Italy’s bread culture, evolving into pasta, a modern Italian staple. Early forms of lasagna-like dishes reveal the Romans' shaping influence on Italian cuisine.</p>
        
        <h3>Meat, Seafood, and Proteins</h3>
        <p>Romans cooked a variety of meats and seafood, often enhanced with fermented fish sauces, precursors to modern anchovy condiments. This legacy endures in Italy’s coastal cuisine.</p>
        
        <h3>Wine and Fermentation</h3>
        <p>Roman winemaking and fermentation practices were integral to daily life and celebrations, setting the stage for Italy’s renowned wine traditions and extensive variety of cheeses.</p>
        
        <h3>Culinary Techniques</h3>
        <p>Romans pioneered techniques later refined by Italian cooks, from baking and boiling to the use of early ovens, echoing in Italian pizza ovens and other cooking methods today.</p>
        
        <p>The Roman culinary legacy, rooted in fresh ingredients and robust flavors, still influences Italian cuisine, setting a high standard for food and flavor worldwide.</p>
